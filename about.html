                        Passed down from generation to generation, they are used to explain common natural phenomena to kids, teach them life lessons, and offer them a glimpse into our history and traditional values. 
                        While myth and legend offers little in the way of tourist attractions they do provide an insight into the local people, their beliefs and sometimes the reason for their behaviour.</p>
